# Privacy Policy for Affiliate Agent

**Last Updated:** [Date]

This Privacy Policy describes how the Affiliate Agent application ("the Service", "the Agent") collects, uses, and handles information. This Service is a self-hosted tool designed to be operated by a single administrator ("the User", "you").

---

### 1. Information We Collect

The Affiliate Agent is designed to automate affiliate marketing and does not collect personal data from visitors or end-users of the social media accounts it posts to. The only data processed by the agent is data provided by its administrator during configuration.

This data includes:

- **Service Credentials:** API keys, tokens, and secrets for third-party services such as Bitly, OpenAI, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest. These are used solely to authenticate with and use these services on the User's behalf.
- **Configuration Data:** The User's affiliate tags (e.g., Amazon Affiliate Tag), target URLs for research, and scheduling preferences.
- **Product Information:** The Agent scrapes public product information (such as product titles, descriptions, and image URLs) from public web pages (e.g., Amazon best-seller pages). This information is non-personal.
- **Generated Content:** The Agent stores marketing content (e.g., tweets, pin descriptions) generated by OpenAI.
- **Performance Data:** The Agent tracks click-through counts on the affiliate links it generates to measure content performance. This is aggregate, anonymous data and is not tied to any individual.

### 2. How We Use Information

The information collected is used exclusively for the core functionality of the Affiliate Agent, which includes:

- Authenticating with third-party APIs to post content.
- Transforming product URLs into affiliate links.
- Shortening links for tracking and sharing.
- Generating marketing content based on public product data.
- Scheduling and publishing content to the User's configured social media accounts.
- Analyzing the performance of different content variations to optimize marketing strategy.

### 3. Data Storage and Security

All collected information (credentials, product data, generated content, and analytics) is stored in a local, file-based H2 database within the application's deployment environment.

- When deployed via Docker, this data persists in a secure Docker volume.
- Access to the application's UI and API is protected by HTTP Basic Authentication, configured by the User.
- The User is responsible for securing the environment where the Agent is hosted and for keeping all API credentials and application passwords confidential.

### 4. Data Sharing and Third Parties

The Affiliate Agent does not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to outside parties.

The Agent interacts with the following third-party services as part of its core function. We recommend you review their privacy policies:

- **OpenAI:** For generating marketing content. [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy)
- **Bitly:** For shortening and tracking affiliate links. [Bitly Privacy Policy](https://bitly.com/pages/privacy)
- **Twitter/X:** For posting content. [X Privacy Policy](https://twitter.com/en/privacy)
- **Meta (Facebook):** For posting content. [Meta Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy)
- **Pinterest:** For posting content. [Pinterest Privacy Policy](https://policy.pinterest.com/en/privacy-policy)

The Agent only sends the necessary data to these services to perform its automated tasks (e.g., sending generated text to Twitter to create a tweet).

### 5. Your Rights and Choices

As the sole administrator of the Service, you have complete control over your data. You can view, modify, or delete any data stored by the application via the application's UI or by managing the database file directly. Deleting the application and its associated data volume will permanently remove all stored information.

### 6. Children's Privacy

This Service is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. The Agent does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children.

### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the application's source code. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
